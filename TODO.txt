    Create:  from what?  need to show how to construct a Graph from a CSC data
    structure, like mex_get_graph, but in a user C++ program (not using 
    readgraph from a file, but from a user CSC data structure)

    code: in SuiteSparse
    http://suitesparse.com

    no Graph Create (_parent) in C++ API
    
    describe Graph
        p
        i
        x
        w
        p, i, x, w, shallow or not?

        can w be null?
        can x be null?

    use ternary for Gx and Gw

SuiteSparse_config: update with latest version ../SuiteSparse_config

cs_*:

    do we just make Mongoose depend on CSparse/CXSparse?  OK, maybe not...
    since it's too embedded.

    delete "finding strongly connected components" from comments:

        /**
         * Fundamental sparse matrix operations.
         *
         * A subset of the CSparse library is used for its sparse matrix data
         * structure and efficient fundamental matrix operations, such as adding,
         * permuting, and finding strongly connected components.
